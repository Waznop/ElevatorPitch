# ElevatorPitch

You are an elevator operator in charge of bringing your clients to the right floor using your pitch to control the elevator. Be careful though, each client is only willing to wait for you so long before you lose your job. 

What kind of ride are you taking your clients on?

This is an app made in the context of CS489 - Audio Processing at the University of Waterloo, by Hong Tai Wei and Adrienne Chan in Winter 2018.
